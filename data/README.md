# Datasets

Use this directory to store datasets. Do NOT put the data on GitHub, of course!

## MNIST

For MNIST, I just downloaded a [pre-processed version from here][1]. Note that
this page also shows how to use the code, but they're using Python 2 it seems
since `cPickle` is effectively `pickle` in Python 3.
