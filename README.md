# MCMC_and_Dynamics

Practice with MCMC methods and dynamics (Langevin, Hamiltonian, etc.)

For now I'll put up a few random scripts, but later I'd like to get some common
code up for quickly testing different algorithms and problem cases.

- `standard_mcmc`: "Standard" or basic MCMC methods, mostly to get my feet wet
  in this. (Keep the file name like this since I reference it in [my BAIR blog
  post][1].)

- `hmc`: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

- `bnn`: Bayesian Neural Networks
