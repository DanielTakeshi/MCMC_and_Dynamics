# MCMC_and_Dynamics

Practice with MCMC methods and dynamics (Langevin, Hamiltonian, etc.)

For now I'll put up a few random scripts, but later I'd like to get some common
code up for quickly testing different algorithms and problem cases.

The `standard_mcmc` repository contains, well, standard MCMC methods (not
"fancy" ones).
